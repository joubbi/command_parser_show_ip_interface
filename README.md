# command_parser_show_ip_interface

This is a command parser for [Ansible__](https://www.ansible.com/) [__network-engine__](https://github.com/ansible-network/network-engine).

It issues the Cisco IOS command **'show ip interface'** and parses the output.

The file **show_ip_interface.yml** is a playbook using the parser.
It can be used as an example and should be self-explanatory.


Inspiration came from this great blog:
