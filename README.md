# command_parser_show_ip_interface

This is a command parser for Ansible network-engine.

It issues the Cisco IOS command **'show ip interface'** and parses the output.


Inspiration and explanations comes from this blog:
https://termlen0.github.io/2018/06/26/observations/

The file **show_ip_interface.yml** is a playbook using the parser.
It can be used as an example and should be self-explanatory.
